Mirrortouch is an experimental design for a multitouch input system which is fast, cheap and simple. A mirrortouch system would involve only 2 small mirrors and a cheap visible light webcam. In theory, the  mirror redirects light at a angle in which it gives a rough estimation on the positioning of the touch and the depth (touch, and every minute distance above it). From that information (gathered from 2 mirrors, giving an x and y axis), the software reconstructs a rough possible position of the touch event (since there are only 2 points of data, it suffers from the issue of occlusion). It verifies all possible touch points by analyzing the visible point of contact for characteristics of a touch event (like the tip of a finger normally covers 24-40% of the perimeter of the surrounding box, etc.). All of this happens very fast, as the initial scanning only occurs on 2, pixel wide lengths. So while a 1024x1024 input image would scan through about a million pixels in a normal multitouch system, this one would scan through less than 512 times less.
